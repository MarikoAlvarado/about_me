    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm 27 years old and I currently live in Seattle, WA!
        Before moving here in 2017 I lived in Savannah, GA, where I was stationed while serving in the Army.
        I served from January 2013 until January 2017 as a Black Hawk Helicopter crew chief and mechanic.
        After moving here I attended Shoreline Community College, interested in environmental science and sustainability.
        I changed my mind and decided to instead pursue an education where I could later work in human services, more specifically as a high school counselor.
        In winter 2019 I transferred to The University of Washington for two programs, Sociology and Education, Communities and Organizations.
        While in college I worked in retail for a bit, at a restaurant as a dishwasher and even in a food truck once! My most previous
        job was working as security for concerts and holiday/special events at Woodland Park Zoo. When I decided to take a break from school
        earlier this year and our world was struck with Covid-19 I ended up in limbo like most others. I'm at Code Fellows because I'm curious about what it 
        takes to become a Web Developer and I know that it would greatly strengthen my ability to find employment where I can explore other ways
        of making a change.
